# jwt_boilerplate
Boilerplate code for a flask API using a JWT-based authorization scheme.

### To run:
Update the following files for a development environment:

Changes to these files will not be tracked in git, the environment variables already set in the .env files are used for continuous integration testing.

```
docker-compose up --build
```
